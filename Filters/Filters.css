/* CSS filters allow you to apply visual effects to elements, commonly used for images but also applicable to other elements like backgrounds. Hereâ€™s a rundown of popular CSS filter functions and their usage:

1. blur()
Blurs an element by a specified amount.

img {
    filter: blur(5px);  Blurs the image by 5 pixels 
}
2. brightness()
Adjusts the brightness of an element. Values >100% make it brighter, <100% make it darker.

img {
    filter: brightness(150%);  Increases brightness by 50% 
}
3. contrast()
Increases or decreases the contrast of an element. 100% is the default, <100% lowers contrast, >100% increases it.

img {
    filter: contrast(80%); Lowers contrast by 20% 
}
4. grayscale()
Converts the element to grayscale. Values range from 0% (original color) to 100% (completely grayscale).

img {
    filter: grayscale(100%);  Turns the image black and white 
}
5. hue-rotate()
Rotates the hues of the element by a specified angle in degrees (0 to 360).

img {
    filter: hue-rotate(90deg);  Changes colors by rotating hues 90 degrees 
}
6. invert()
Inverts the colors of an element. Useful for night modes or special effects.

img {
    filter: invert(100%); Inverts colors to create a negative image 
}
7. opacity()
Adjusts the transparency of an element. 100% is fully opaque, and 0% is fully transparent.

img {
    filter: opacity(50%);  Sets the image opacity to 50% 
}
8. saturate()
Adjusts the color saturation. A value of 0% is completely desaturated (grayscale), 100% is normal saturation, and values above 100% increase saturation.

img {
    filter: saturate(200%);  Doubles the color saturation 
}
9. sepia()
Applies a sepia tone (a warm, brownish tint) to the element. 100% gives a fully sepia effect.

img {
    filter: sepia(100%); Makes the image sepia-toned 
}
10. drop-shadow()
Adds a shadow that follows the shape of the image or element, unlike the box-shadow, which applies a box-shaped shadow.

img {
    filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5));  Adds a 3D-like shadow 
}
Combining Filters
You can apply multiple filters by separating them with spaces.

img {
    filter: grayscale(100%) brightness(80%) blur(2px); Combines grayscale, brightness, and blur 
}
Example with Hover Effect
You can add filters on hover to create interactive effects:

img {
    filter: grayscale(50%);
    transition: filter 0.3s ease;
}

img:hover {
    filter: grayscale(0%) brightness(1.2);
}
CSS filters can give images and elements unique, eye-catching effects, enhancing the user experience.
