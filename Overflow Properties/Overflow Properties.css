CSS overflow properties control what happens when content overflows the boundaries of its container. Let's break down the main overflow properties and their values:

1. overflow Property
The overflow property applies to block elements (like div, section, p, etc.) and determines what happens when the content overflows the element's box. It accepts the following values:

visible (default): Content that overflows the container's boundaries remains visible. No clipping occurs, meaning content extends outside the container's box.

overflow: visible;
hidden: Content that overflows the container is clipped, meaning it gets cut off at the container's edges and is not displayed.

overflow: hidden;
scroll: Adds both horizontal and vertical scrollbars to the container, regardless of whether the content actually overflows or not. This allows users to scroll within the container to see overflowed content.

overflow: scroll;
auto: Adds scrollbars only if the content overflows. If there’s no overflow, no scrollbar is shown. It’s an adaptive option that provides scrollbars only when necessary.

overflow: auto;
clip: Similar to hidden, clip simply hides the content that overflows but without providing a scrolling option.

overflow: clip;
Note: The shorthand overflow property applies to both horizontal and vertical overflow simultaneously. To control each axis individually, use overflow-x and overflow-y.

2. overflow-x and overflow-y
These properties control overflow independently on the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes:

overflow-x: Controls overflow on the horizontal axis.

overflow-x: auto;
overflow-y: Controls overflow on the vertical axis.

overflow-y: scroll;
You can use these properties to, for example, allow vertical scrolling while clipping the content horizontally:

overflow-x: hidden;
overflow-y: auto;
3. overflow-wrap
The overflow-wrap property is used with text content and determines how the browser handles words that might overflow the container’s width.

normal: Words only break at normal line breaks.
break-word: Words will break if necessary to prevent overflow.
Example:

overflow-wrap: break-word;
4. text-overflow
The text-overflow property handles how to represent overflowed text when it’s clipped. It's commonly used with overflow: hidden; and white-space: nowrap;.

clip: Cuts off the text without any visual indication.
ellipsis: Displays an ellipsis (...) to indicate clipped text.
Example:

white-space: nowrap;
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
Summary of Typical Use Cases
Showing Scrollbars Only When Needed:

overflow: auto;
Clipping Overflow without Scrollbars:

overflow: hidden;
Adding Ellipsis to Overflowed Text:

white-space: nowrap;
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
These properties help control and manage content overflow in flexible and visually appealing ways, especially for layouts with limited space or specific content boundaries. */
